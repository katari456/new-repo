GIT STASH:
Using the git stash command, developers can temporarily save changes made in the working directory. It allows them to quickly switch contexts when they are not quite ready to commit changes. And it allows them to more easily switch between branches.
Generally, the stash's meaning is "store something safely in a hidden place."
